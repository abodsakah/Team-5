# Team 5 project
This is the main repository for the project of Team 5 at BTH for the course PA1416.

## Front end
We are using react with MUI as a front end.

### Setup

Start by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abodsakah/Team-5
```

Go into the directory:
```bash
cd Team-5
```

And from there you can start by installing the dependencies by running the `yarn` command, if you dont have yarn already installed, you can install it by running the following command:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

After everything is done you can start the application by running the following command:
```bash
yarn start
```

and that would open a new window in your default browser. But if dosnt you can just open your browser and type in the following url `http://localhost:3000/`.
